# Personal Page
This is my presentation page.

It showcases my most relevant **projects**, as well as an "about me" and "contact" section.

It's available in 2 languages, English and Spanish, and can be changed at any time from the top right corner of the screen.

## Technologies
It was mainly built using [React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It also features swiping support on mobile to navigate through the different sections.

Although styling wise it's fully responisve, it stands out on desktop devices for there still is some performance optimization to be done on mobile.
